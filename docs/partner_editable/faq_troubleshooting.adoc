*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in `%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService` and `C:\cfn\log`.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Ensure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* We recommend that you launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information about AWS CloudFormation quotas, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS documentation^].

*Q.* I deployed the Quick Start in the EU (London) Region, but it didn’t work.

*A.* This Quick Start includes services that aren’t supported in all Regions. See the pages for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/fh.html[Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose], http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#glue_region[AWS Glue], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sagemaker_region[Amazon SageMaker], and http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c-spectrum-data-files.html[Amazon Redshift Spectrum] on the AWS website for a list of supported Regions.

*Q.* Can I use the Quick Start with my own data?

*A.* Yes, you can.

The data lake foundation provides a base for your processes. Using this infrastructure, you can:

* Ingest batch submissions, resulting in curated datasets in Amazon S3. You can then use your own SQL scripts to load curated datasets to Amazon Redshift.
* Ingest streaming submissions provided through Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
* Auto-discover curated datasets using AWS Glue crawlers, and transform curated datasets with AWS Glue jobs.
* Analyze the data with Amazon Redshift, using your own SQL queries.
* Analyze the data with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics, by creating your own applications that read streaming data from Kinesis Data Firehose.
* Publish the results of analytics to the published datasets bucket.
* Get a high-level picture of your data lake by using Amazon ES, which indexes the metadata of S3 objects.
* Use Amazon Athena to run ad hoc analytics over your curated datasets, and Amazon QuickSight to visualize the datasets in the published datasets bucket. You can also use Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift as data sources in Amazon QuickSight.
